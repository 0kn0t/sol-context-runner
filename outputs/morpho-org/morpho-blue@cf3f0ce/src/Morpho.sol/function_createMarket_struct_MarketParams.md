@notice Creates the market `marketParams`.
 @dev Here is the list of assumptions on the market's dependencies (tokens, IRM and oracle) that guarantees
 Morpho behaves as expected:
 - The token should be ERC-20 compliant, except that it can omit return values on `transfer` and `transferFrom`.
 - The token balance of Morpho should only decrease on `transfer` and `transferFrom`. In particular, tokens with
 burn functions are not supported.
 - The token should not re-enter Morpho on `transfer` nor `transferFrom`.
 - The token balance of the sender (resp. receiver) should decrease (resp. increase) by exactly the given amount
 on `transfer` and `transferFrom`. In particular, tokens with fees on transfer are not supported.
 - The IRM should not re-enter Morpho.
 - The oracle should return a price with the correct scaling.
 - The oracle price should not be able to change instantly such that the new price is less than the old price
 multiplied by LLTV*LIF. In particular, if the loan asset is a vault that can receive donations, the oracle
 should not price its shares using the AUM.
 @dev Here is a list of assumptions on the market's dependencies which, if broken, could break Morpho's liveness
 properties (funds could get stuck):
 - The token should not revert on `transfer` and `transferFrom` if balances and approvals are right.
 - The amount of assets supplied and borrowed should not be too high (max ~1e32), otherwise the number of shares
 might not fit within 128 bits.
 - The IRM should not revert on `borrowRate`.
 - The IRM should not return a very high borrow rate (otherwise the computation of `interest` in
 `_accrueInterest` can overflow).
 - The oracle should not revert `price`.
 - The oracle should not return a very high price (otherwise the computation of `maxBorrow` in `_isHealthy` or of
 `assetsRepaid` in `liquidate` can overflow).
 @dev The borrow share price of a market with less than 1e4 assets borrowed can be decreased by manipulations, to
 the point where `totalBorrowShares` is very large and borrowing overflows.
