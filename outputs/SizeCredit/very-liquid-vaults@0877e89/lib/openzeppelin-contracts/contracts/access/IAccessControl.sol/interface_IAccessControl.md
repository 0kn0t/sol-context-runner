## Events

### RoleAdminChanged

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when `newAdminRole` is set as ``role``'s admin role, replacing `previousAdminRole`
///  `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is the starting admin for all roles, despite
///  {RoleAdminChanged} not being emitted to signal this.
event RoleAdminChanged(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed previousAdminRole, bytes32 indexed newAdminRole);
```

### RoleGranted

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when `account` is granted `role`.
///  `sender` is the account that originated the contract call. This account bears the admin role (for the granted role).
///  Expected in cases where the role was granted using the internal {AccessControl-_grantRole}.
event RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);
```

### RoleRevoked

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when `account` is revoked `role`.
///  `sender` is the account that originated the contract call:
///    - if using `revokeRole`, it is the admin role bearer
///    - if using `renounceRole`, it is the role bearer (i.e. `account`)
event RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);
