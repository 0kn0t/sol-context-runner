# Interface: IERC1363

## Metadata

- **Name**: IERC1363
- **Type**: Interface
- **Path**: lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IERC1363.sol
- **Documentation**:  @title IERC1363
   @dev Interface of the ERC-1363 standard as defined in the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363[ERC-1363].
   Defines an extension interface for ERC-20 tokens that supports executing code on a recipient contract
   after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or code on a spender contract after `approve`, in a single transaction.

## Implements Interfaces

- **IERC165** [lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol/interface_IERC165.md]
- **IERC20** [lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol/interface_IERC20.md]

## Events

### Transfer (inherited from IERC20)

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
///  another (`to`).
///  Note that `value` may be zero.
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

### Approval (inherited from IERC20)

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by
///  a call to {approve}. `value` is the new allowance.
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```
