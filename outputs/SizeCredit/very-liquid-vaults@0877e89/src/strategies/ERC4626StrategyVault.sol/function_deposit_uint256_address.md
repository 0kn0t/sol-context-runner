## Documentation

### Function Documentation

@dev See {IERC4626-deposit}. 

### Interface Documentation

 @dev Mints shares Vault shares to receiver by depositing exactly amount of underlying tokens.
 - MUST emit the Deposit event.
 - MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the
   deposit execution, and are accounted for during deposit.
 - MUST revert if all of assets cannot be deposited (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not
   approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).
 NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vaultâ€™s underlying asset token.
