## Documentation

### Function Documentation

 @dev See {IERC20-approve}.
 NOTE: If `value` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
 `transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.
 Requirements:
 - `spender` cannot be the zero address.

### Interface Documentation

 @dev Sets a `value` amount of tokens as the allowance of `spender` over the
 caller's tokens.
 Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
 IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
 that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
 transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
 condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
 desired value afterwards:
