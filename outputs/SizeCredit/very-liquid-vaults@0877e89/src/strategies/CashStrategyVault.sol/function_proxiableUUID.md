## Implementation

```solidity
///  @dev Implementation of the ERC-1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the
///  implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade.
///  IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
///  bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
///  function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.
function proxiableUUID() virtual external view notDelegated() returns (bytes32) {
    return ERC1967Utils.IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
}

## Documentation

### Function Documentation

 @dev Implementation of the ERC-1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the
 implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade.
 IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
 bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
 function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.

### Interface Documentation

 @dev Returns the storage slot that the proxiable contract assumes is being used to store the implementation
 address.
 IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
 bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
 function revert if invoked through a proxy.
