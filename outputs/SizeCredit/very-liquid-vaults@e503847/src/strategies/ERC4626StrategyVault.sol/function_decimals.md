## Implementation

```solidity
///  @dev Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
///  For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
///  be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
///  Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
///  Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless
///  it's overridden.
///  NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
///  no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
///  {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.
